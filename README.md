# Beats, Rhymes, and Neural Nets Codebase

This is essentially a stripped back and slightly more pretty version of the Whisper.cpp wasm demos.

You'll need Firefox or Chrome to run the project.

To start it up, clone the project, `cd` into it, and from the terminal run:

`python3 server.py`

Take a look at the [Proper Whisper Repo](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) if you want to dive deeper. It's highly encouraged!
